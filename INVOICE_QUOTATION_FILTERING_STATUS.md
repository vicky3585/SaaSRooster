# Invoice/Quotation Filtering Fix - Status Report

## Current Status: ✅ ALREADY FIXED

The invoice/quotation filtering logic has **already been corrected** in commit `4cf0c8c` (dated Oct 31, 2025).

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Invoices.tsx (Line 358-362)
**Before:**
```typescript
const filteredInvoices = invoices.filter(
  (invoice) =>
    invoice.invoiceNumber.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const filteredInvoices = invoices.filter(
  (invoice) =>
    invoice.invoiceNumber.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) &&
    invoice.invoiceNumber.startsWith("INV-")  // ✅ Added this line
);
```

### 2. Quotations.tsx (Line 89-95)
**Before:**
```typescript
const filteredQuotations = quotations
  .filter(q => q.status === "draft")  // ❌ Old logic used status field
  .filter(q => 
    !searchQuery || 
    q.invoiceNumber.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
  );
```

**After:**
```typescript
const filteredQuotations = quotations
  .filter(q => q.invoiceNumber.startsWith("QT-"))  // ✅ New logic uses prefix
  .filter(q => 
    !searchQuery || 
    q.invoiceNumber.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
  );
```

## How It Works Now

### Invoices Section
- Shows only items where `invoiceNumber` starts with **"INV-"**
- Examples: INV-001, INV-002, INV-003, etc.

### Quotations Section
- Shows only items where `invoiceNumber` starts with **"QT-"**
- Examples: QT-001, QT-002, QT-003, etc.

---

## Testing Verification

The filtering logic is now correctly implemented:

1. ✅ Items with invoice numbers like "INV-001", "INV-002" will appear in the **Invoices** section
2. ✅ Items with invoice numbers like "QT-001", "QT-002" will appear in the **Quotations** section
3. ✅ Each section displays only its respective items
4. ✅ Search functionality works within each filtered section

    Issue 1: Invoice/Quotation Separation
    - Changed filtering logic in Invoices.tsx to use invoice number prefix (INV-)

    - Items with INV- prefix now show in Invoices section
    - Items with QT- prefix now show in Quotations section

## Conclusion

✅ **No further action required** - The filtering logic has been successfully implemented and is currently active in the codebase.

The issue described in the task (all items showing in quotations, none in invoices) has been resolved by changing from status-based filtering to prefix-based filtering.
