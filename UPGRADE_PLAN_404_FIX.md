# Upgrade Plan 404 Error Fix

## Issue Description
When a user logged in as an organization clicked on "upgrade plan" from the Settings page (Billing & Subscription tab), they encountered a 404 page not found error.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The Settings page (lines 929, 966, 971 in `Settings.tsx`) contained links pointing to `/subscription`
2. The routing configuration in `App.tsx` only had a route for `/subscription/payment` in the PublicRouter
3. There was no `/subscription` route defined in the AuthenticatedRouter
4. This caused the application to return a 404 error when authenticated users clicked the upgrade plan links

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Route to AuthenticatedRouter (`client/src/App.tsx`)
```typescript
<Route path="/subscription" component={() => <ProtectedRoute component={SubscriptionPayment} />} />
```

**Changes Made:**
- Added the `/subscription` route to the `AuthenticatedRouter` function
- This route renders the `SubscriptionPayment` component with protection
- The existing code already handles `/subscription/*` paths to display without sidebar/header (line 156)

### 2. Enhanced SubscriptionPayment Component (`client/src/pages/SubscriptionPayment.tsx`)

**Changes Made:**
- Imported `useAuth` hook from AuthContext
- Modified the `useEffect` hook to prioritize authenticated user data
- The component now automatically populates:
  - Organization ID from `user.currentOrgId`
  - Email from `user.email`
  - Full Name from `user.fullName`
- Falls back to URL parameters if user is not authenticated (maintains backward compatibility)

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added import
import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext";

// Get user from auth context
const { user } = useAuth();

// Updated useEffect to prioritize auth context data
useEffect(() => {
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const orgId = urlParams.get("orgId");
  const email = urlParams.get("email");
  const name = urlParams.get("name");
  
  // Prioritize authenticated user data, fall back to URL params
  if (user) {
    setCustomerInfo({
      organizationId: user.currentOrgId || orgId || "",
      email: user.email || email || "",
      name: user.fullName || name || "",
      phone: "",
    });
  } else {
    // Original logic for non-authenticated access
    // ...
  }
}, [user]);
```

## Testing Results

### Test Scenario 1: "Upgrade Plan" Button
1. Logged in as an organization user (Test Organization)
2. Navigated to Settings → Billing & Subscription tab
3. Clicked "Upgrade Plan" button
4. ✅ Successfully navigated to `/subscription`
5. ✅ Subscription plans displayed correctly (Free, Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
6. ✅ User information pre-filled:
   - Full Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "testuser@example.com"

### Test Scenario 2: "View Plans & Upgrade" Button
1. From the same Settings → Billing & Subscription page
2. Clicked "View Plans & Upgrade" button
3. ✅ Successfully navigated to `/subscription`
4. ✅ All subscription plans displayed
5. ✅ User can select a plan and proceed to payment

### Test Scenario 3: Plan Selection and Payment Form
1. Selected the Basic plan (₹999.00/monthly)
2. ✅ Plan marked as "Selected"
3. ✅ Payment Information form appeared
4. ✅ Customer details auto-populated from authenticated user
5. ✅ Payment button displays correct amount: "Pay ₹999.00"

## Files Modified
1. `client/src/App.tsx` - Added `/subscription` route to AuthenticatedRouter
2. `client/src/pages/SubscriptionPayment.tsx` - Enhanced to use auth context data

## Benefits
1. **No More 404 Errors**: Users can successfully access the subscription page from settings
2. **Improved UX**: User information is automatically populated, reducing friction
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Still works with URL parameters for public/unauthenticated access
4. **Consistent Routing**: Both authenticated and public subscription flows are properly handled
5. **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing subscription payment system and PayUmoney integration

## Additional Notes
- The `/subscription` path is already configured to display without sidebar/header (line 156 in App.tsx)
- The subscription plans are fetched from the backend API: `/api/subscription-payments/plans`
- The payment flow integrates with PayUmoney for secure payment processing
- Trial period information is displayed correctly (Trial ends 11/11/2025)
