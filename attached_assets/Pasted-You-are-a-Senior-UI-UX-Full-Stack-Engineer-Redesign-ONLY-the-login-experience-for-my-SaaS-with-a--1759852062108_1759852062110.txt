You are a Senior UI/UX + Full-Stack Engineer. Redesign ONLY the login experience for my SaaS with a premium, trustworthy look—WITHOUT heavy dependencies or unnecessary refactors. Keep token/credit use minimal: do a single pass, reuse existing stack, and show concise diffs.

GOALS
- Professional login screen with “Flying Venture System” branding.
- Keep routes/auth logic unchanged; just improve UI/UX and basic validation.
- Add a small “Admin Login” link that navigates to /admin/login (no admin code changes here).

CONSTRAINTS (CREDIT-SAVING)
- Detect current stack (React/Vue/Svelte/etc.) and styling (Tailwind/CSS/SCSS). Reuse it.
- NO new large UI libraries. Prefer lightweight components and existing tokens/utilities.
- Provide ONE SVG logo + minimal CSS; compress assets; no large images.
- One PR with small, focused diffs; update README snippet only if necessary.

UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- Layout: Split-screen (left brand pane, right auth card) on desktop; single-column on mobile.
- Branding: Title “Flying Venture System” with a simple FVS monogram SVG. Tagline: “Smart Billing • GST Compliance • Insights”.
- Form: 
  • Fields: Email, Password (with show/hide), optional Organization Code/Slug if my app uses multi-tenant subdomains.  
  • Buttons: “Sign In” (primary), “Create Account”, “Forgot Password?”  
  • Tiny link (top-right or below form): “Admin Login” → /admin/login
- Visual polish: Subtle gradients, soft shadows, rounded-xl, focus rings, hover/active states, dark mode supported (prefers-color-scheme).
- Accessibility: Proper labels, aria-invalid, error helper text, keyboard navigation (Tab/Enter), success/error toasts.
- Content: Short trust copy under button: “By continuing you agree to Terms • Privacy”.
- Security affordances: Disable button while submitting; generic error messaging (avoid leaking user existence).

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- If Tailwind present: create <LoginPage.tsx|vue> with utility classes; extract colors in tailwind.config if needed (brand-600/700).
- If plain CSS: add a small login.css (≤200 lines) with variables: --brand, --bg, --card, --text.
- Add small FVS.svg (inlineable) and use it in the branding pane.
- Do not change authentication endpoints or server logic; reuse existing handlers.
- Keep i18n-ready copy (strings in a constants module) but don’t add a full i18n system.

STATE & VALIDATION
- Client-side: basic required checks + email format.  
- Show inline errors; preserve field values on failure.
- Remember-me checkbox only if already supported—otherwise omit.

TESTS & ACCEPTANCE
- Snapshot/visual test for light/dark.  
- a11y smoke (tab order + screen reader labels).  
- Mobile viewport check (≤375px width).  
- Confirm “Admin Login” link is visible pre-login and routes to /admin/login.

DELIVERABLES
- New/updated Login component + minimal styles (or Tailwind classes).
- FVS.svg asset.  
- Small README note: where to adjust brand colors/logo.

Proceed and show the minimal diffs and updated files.
