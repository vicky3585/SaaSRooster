## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Action: Push to GitHub

The changes have been committed locally but need to be pushed to GitHub.

### Why the Push Failed

The GitHub access token currently doesn't have write permissions to push directly to the repository.

### üîß Solution Options

#### Option 1: Manual Push (Recommended)

**On your local machine:**

```bash
# Navigate to your local repository
cd /path/to/bizverse

# Pull the latest changes from the remote
git pull origin main

# The changes should be automatically synced
# If not, you can manually pull from the server

# Then push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

#### Option 2: Grant GitHub App Permissions

1. Visit the GitHub App permissions page:
   - https://github.com/apps/abacusai/installations/select_target

2. Select the repository: `vicky3585/SaaSRooster`

3. Grant the following permissions:
   - ‚úÖ Contents: Read and Write
   - ‚úÖ Pull Requests: Read and Write
   - ‚úÖ Workflows: Read and Write

4. Save the changes

5. The system will automatically retry the push

#### Option 3: Use SSH Key (Alternative)

```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "hugenetwork7@gmail.com"

# Add to GitHub: Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key
# Copy the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Update git remote
cd /home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/bizverse
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:vicky3585/SaaSRooster.git

# Push
git push origin main
```

#### Option 4: Create a Pull Request

If direct push continues to fail, create a feature branch and PR:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/bizverse

# The branch already exists
git checkout feature/comprehensive-docs-and-cicd

# When permissions are granted, push:
git push -u origin feature/comprehensive-docs-and-cicd

# Then create a PR on GitHub to merge to main
```

     - `SERVER_HOST` - Your production server IP/hostname
     - `SERVER_USER` - SSH username for deployment
     - `ENV_FILE` - Production .env file content (optional)

4. **Test Docker Deployment Locally**
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/code_artifacts/bizverse
   docker-compose up -d
